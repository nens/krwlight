KRW "light", simple demo
==========================================

Introduction

Usage, etc.


TODO (perhaps): before releasing the site, adjust ``fabfile.cfg`` to point at
the correct server and configure raven/sentry and gaug.es in the django
settings.

**Warning**: temp site; I installed it by hand on **s-web-ws-00-d6**.

Note: it requires a ``htpasswd`` file in the project root.

Note: you need to copy/paste Jordie's csv files into ``var/csv``.
